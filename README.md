# react-native-learning-journey

This repository includes my react native apps. I developed theese apps while learning.

To run these apps you need to install expo. You might want to check [Expo Documentation](https://docs.expo.dev/get-started/installation/).

After installation of expo, you should change directory to src folder. And then, basically run following command, and enjoy!

```bash
npm run start
```
